</p>

## Compilation
Compile in x86 and Release and it should work out of the box.

## Inject
Any injector will do. Just use it to inject the DLL into the target process while being in the main menu.

## Disclaimer
It's very important to note that this project is for educational use only. We do not condone this software being used to gain an advantage against other people. I made this project for my university project to show how cheating software works and how it is possible to block these kinda manipulations in the future.
