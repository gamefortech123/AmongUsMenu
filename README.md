<p align="center">
   AmongUsMenu is a Cheat Menu for the popular Game Among Us.
</p>

## Disclaimer
It's very important to note that this project is for educational use only. We do not condone this software being used to gain an advantage against other people. I made this project for my university project to show how cheating software works and how it is possible to block these kinda manipulations in the future.

## Compile (Configurations)
You can compile two different versions of the menu. Normal or Xinput.

### Normal (AmongUsMenu.dll)
Inject it with any injector you can find out there. Should work just fine. Resources folder needs to be in the same path as the dll.

- Debug (With Debug Information and can be attached to process)
- Release (Optimized with all information stripped)

### Xinput (xinput1_3.dll)
Will automatically be loaded by the Game itself if the dll is in the game directory. Make sure to include the resources folder into the same path as the game directory too.

- Debug_Xinput (With Debug Information and can be attached to process)
- Release_Xinput (Optimized with all information stripped)
